# Task notes format

Write the complete replacement JSON string with `task_notes(operation="write", content=..., expected_version=...)`. Start at version 0; each reply supplies the next version. After missing context or a version conflict, read with `operation="read", content=null, expected_version=null`. Maximum content length: 12000 characters. Keep completed branches concise: retain their IDs, relationships, result and evidence, but remove obsolete action plans and repeated prose. Keep each item subtotal in one member entry and refer to it from goals instead of duplicating the ledger.

Tree shape follows the task. This example has a root, two intermediate layers on one branch, and leaves at different depths. The current action plan is stored separately in `active` (labels illustrate structure, not task content):

```text
g0 Task end state (root)
├─ g1 Contributing result A (intermediate)
│  ├─ g11 Finer result A1 (intermediate)
│  │  ├─ g111 Directly pursuable result A1a (leaf)
│  │  └─ g112 Directly pursuable result A1b (leaf)
│  └─ g12 Directly pursuable result A2 (leaf)
├─ g2 Directly pursuable result B (leaf)
└─ g3 Directly pursuable result C (leaf)
```

Here `g111.parent_id` is `g11`, and `g11.parent_id` is `g1`. If A2 requires B, set `g12.depends_on` to `["g2"]` while keeping `g12.parent_id` as `g1`. Do not copy the example's depth or counts; expand any leaf if it later needs decomposition.

Use the following fields. Only two goal records are shown for brevity; put **every node**, including intermediate parents and deeper descendants, in the flat `goals` list:

```json
{
  "format": "goal-tree-v2",
  "root_id": "g0",
  "requirements": [{"id": "r1", "condition": "Required result or constraint", "basis": "explicit or assumed"}],
  "goals": [{
    "id": "g0", "parent_id": null, "goal": "Complete end state in your own words",
    "covers": ["r1"], "depends_on": [], "status": "active",
    "check": "Evidence establishing the complete result", "evidence": []
  }, {
    "id": "g1", "parent_id": "g0", "goal": "Result contributing to its parent", "covers": ["r1"],
    "depends_on": [], "status": "active",
    "check": "Evidence needed to establish this result", "evidence": []
  }],
  "active": {"goal_id": "g1", "steps": ["Immediate next action"], "next_check": "Expected result"},
  "members": [{"label": "local-a", "description": "Recognizable visual features", "location": "Last observed location", "state": "Current task-relevant state", "remaining": "Unfinished work", "count": 1, "evidence": []}],
  "assumptions": [],
  "uncertainties": [],
  "change": "Reason for this revision"
}
```

IDs are unique; only the root has a null parent. Every other `parent_id` references an existing goal; parent links form one tree. Dependencies reference goal IDs and may cross branches. Keep both relations acyclic. Parentage alone does not require sibling execution order; children do not wait for their parent to be done.

Statuses are `pending`, `active`, `done`, `blocked`, `retired`. `active.goal_id` identifies the leaf currently being pursued; its ancestors can also have status `active`. With none ready, set `active.goal_id` to null and `steps` to an empty list.

Use `members` when item coverage matters. Labels are your own, not simulator IDs. An entry represents one item or a distinguishable group in the same state; keep groups disjoint and make count units clear after splitting or processing. Update state and remaining work from RGB and feedback. A spill reopens the affected goal; temporary placement does not complete storage.

For repeated transfers, save each subtotal with the last feedback event it includes in `evidence`. Before changing areas or subtasks, reconcile completed processing and deliveries with `members`; replace stale counts, including any conflicting summary. On resuming, read `action_feedback_since_write` from the returned notes and reconcile those public receipts with the checkpoint before acting or replacing notes. If `omitted` is nonzero or item correspondence is unavailable, mark the affected count uncertain. Keep uninspected supply, work in progress and confirmed delivery distinct. Replace stale entries rather than appending a transcript.

Before finish, use `change` to reconcile each criterion and `uncertainties` for remaining gaps. An evidence ID alone, a successful notes write or a `done` label does not verify a result. Preserve original requirements and valid progress when replacing the state.
