# Jinkai visual-point GT navigation strategy

The candidate sampling and scoring in `executors/gt_navigation.py` are adapted
from https://github.com/dadwadw233/habitat-gs, branch `jinkai/harness`, commit
`0815cf234ee591bacd8017e9b1def4fac13e649b`, specifically
`tools/habitat_agent/oracle_local_nav/visual_point.py`.

The bounded projection, reachable-candidate selection, and feedback-navigation
design also refer to `oracle_local_nav/standoff.py` and
`src_python/habitat_sim/habitat_adapter_internal/mixins_navigation.py`.
Habitat's C++ navmesh and native greedy follower are not bundled. The project
provides an OmniGibson grid and kinematic follower adapter. See
`docs/gt_navigation.md` for the exact adaptation and validation boundary.
